Use of AI 
In this project, we followed the course guidelines for responsible and limited use of AI. To apply AI effectively, it was necessary to have a solid understanding of basic R concepts. Since our group had different levels of experience with R, we spent time establishing shared knowledge about the essential components of the R workflow. This included how to run commands in the console, how R projects and working directories function, and how scripts, datasets, and rendering processes are connected. Building this foundation ensured that we could correctly interpret technical explanations from AI and verify whether suggested solutions were appropriate for our project setup.

AI was used primarily as a technical support tool. It helped identify and resolve issues that commonly occur in collaborative R work. Examples include file-path conflicts, missing working directories, and render failures when switching between two different computers. In several cases, R attempted to access folders located only on one team member’s system, or tried to load packages that were not installed on the other member’s machine. By providing AI with screenshots or detailed descriptions of error messages, we were able to isolate the cause of these problems efficiently. All fixes proposed by AI were reviewed and implemented manually to maintain full control over the workflow. We also used AI to improve the quality of our written text by checking grammar, suggesting clearer wording, and helping us express our explanations in a more precise and understandable way.

AI was also used to clarify basic functionality in R, such as how certain commands operate and how to structure an R project correctly. This was particularly useful during the early phase of the project, when we needed to establish routines for handling data, loading packages, and ensuring consistent file organisation across devices. As our competence increased, the use of AI shifted toward more targeted queries. These included questions about improving the efficiency of existing code, adjusting minor details in plots, or identifying why a specific line of code did not run as intended. In each case, AI served as a technical aid rather than a source of analytical input.
